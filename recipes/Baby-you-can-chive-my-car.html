            <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
            <li>1 12- or 16-ounce jar dill pickle chips</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1/4 cup milk or buttermilk (optional)</li>
            <li>Canola or vegetable oil, for frying</li>
            <li>1/2 cup feta cheese, crumbled</li>
            <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
            <li>1/2 cup sour cream</li>

            <li>1/2 cup finely chopped chives</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <h3>Make the Pickles</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the flour, Cajun seasoning, and salt in a large bowl.
                Pat the pickle chips dry
            </li>
            <li>Beat the egg in a small bowl. Drain the pickles chips,
                then dip in the egg, then dredge in the flour mixture to coat
                Add the optional milk or buttermilk to your egg if you're having
                trouble getting the flour to stick to the pickles or getting the flour
                to stick to the pickles or getting an even coat
            </li>
            <li>Heat 2 to 3 inches of oil to about 350 F in a large pot over medium high
                 heat. Fry the pickles in small batches until golden, transferring fried 
                 pickles to paper towels with a slotted spoon. Check your oil temperature
                between batches
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Make the Burgers</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Carefully fold the feta into the beef. Form 4 patties, and season both sides
                lightly with salt and pepper
            </li>
            <li>Cook the patties as you normally would</li>
            <li>Mix the sour cream, mustard, and chopped chives. Spread generously on the top bun.</li>
            <li> BUILD YOUR BURGER: Bottom bun, burger, top bun with spread. Attach 4 fried pickles
                with tooth picks to the side of the bottom bun as if they were wheels. You saw
                this episode, right? Serve while making little car sounds, vroom, vroom.
