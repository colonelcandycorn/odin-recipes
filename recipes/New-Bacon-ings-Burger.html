            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                A classic all-beef patty topped with lettuce, cheddar cheese, onion, tomato,
                and bacon. It's what George WAshington was fighting for. It's what the Statue
                of Liberty wishes it was holding instead of a dumb torch. So use the freshest
                ingredients you can find, down to the bun.

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 pound bacon</li>
                <li>French fries</li>
                <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
                <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
                <li>1 large egg</li>
                <li>4 buns</li>
                <li>Green leaf lettuce</li>
                <li>1 large tomato, sliced</li>
                <li>1 red onion, sliced</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Preheat your oven to 400 F. If you prefer to cook your bacon in a skillet,
                    chop all but 8 slices and fry over medium heat until almost crisp and most 
                    of the fat has rendered. Drain the chopped bacon on paper towels, wipe out
                    the skillet, and fry the remaining slices till crisp. Drain and reserve.
                    Or, spread the strips onto a rack placed in a rimmed baking sheet and bake
                    in the oven until brown and crisp, about 15 to 20 minutes. Reserve 8 slices
                    and finely chop the rest. Keep the oven on.

                <li>
                    Cook your French Fries through the blanching stage but do not deep-fry. 
                    Drain and let cool.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Combine the milk and egg in a large bowl. Coat the blanched cooled fries 
                    in the mixture and spread on a parchment-lined backing sheet. Toss the coated 
                    fries with the chopped bacon and return to the oven for 10 to 15 minutes, until
                     the bacon-y fries are extra crispy.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Meanwhile, make 4 patties, season both sides with salt and pepper, and cook your
                    burgers. When they're just about done, top with the cheese.
                </li>
